# The geometry of the message window.
# The height is measured in number of notifications everything else
# in pixels.  If the width is omitted but the height is given
# ("-geometry x2"), the message window expands over the whole screen
# (dmenu-like).  If width is 0, the window expands to the longest
# message displayed.  A positive x is measured from the left, a
# negative from the right side of the screen.  Y is measured from
# the top and down respectevly.
# The width can be negative.  In this case the actual width is the
# screen width minus the width defined in within the geometry option.
